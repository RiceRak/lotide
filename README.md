* `countLetters(...)`: takes in a sentence and returns a count of each of the letters in the sentence
* `countOnly(...)`: takes in a collection of items and returns a specific subset of those items
* `eqArrays(...)`: takes in 2 arrays and returns true if the arrays are equal in length and false otherwise
* `eqObjects(...)`: takes in 2 objects and return true if they are equal and false otherwise
* `findKey(...)`: takes in an object and callback and returns the first key that meets the criteria specified in callback
* `findKeyByValue(...)`: takes in an object and a value and returns the first key that corresponds to that value
